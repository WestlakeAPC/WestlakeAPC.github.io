**PLEASE BUILD YOUR JADE, SASS, AND TS SOURCES BEFORE COMMITTING**:

**OTHERWISE, GITHUB PAGES WILL READ HTML, CSS, AND JS SOURCES GENERATED IN EARLIER COMMITS, AND THE WEBSITE WILL NOT CHANGE. THIS MAKES THE VOLUNTARY MAINTAINERS' JOBS HARDER.**

**IF YOU CHANGED OR UPDATED THE DEPENDENCY LIST, PLEASE RUN THE FOLLOWING**:

```bash
npm shrinkwrap
yarn
```

**THIS KEEPS THE MAINTAINER'S ENVIRONMENT UP TO DATE WITH YOURS.**
