        Our Purpose:
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Westlake Accessible Programming Club, or simply APC, is an in-school venture to help explain basic logical concepts in a way that tailors to students’ individual learning styles. With three skilled mentors secured for the club, (Joseph Jin, Eli Bradley, and Sam Hollenbeck,) whose games and utilities have already managed to pass Apple’s strict App Review process, we think exploration of the concepts that power everything from server to front-end will be easier than ever. Also, we aim to recruit the best of our members into the board for our app publisher, the ‘API Abusers.’

        </a>
        External Funding:
      </h1>
      <p>
        The only external funding as of this time comes from Joseph Jin’s reserves, to maintain and renew the Apple Developer account we publish our apps under. We will never monetize published applications, through ads, in-app purchases, outright fees, or any other method. We reserve the right to accept external donations.

        Meeting Schedule:
      </h1>
      <p>
        Meetings will happen in Mr. Rosier's room (276) at 4:15 PM on Thursdays, and may last for about an hour. However, the meetings are always voluntary for students. We can always message you the meeting summaries, and in fact, most work gets done elsewhere! Whatever schedule complications you have, we'll adapt to.
